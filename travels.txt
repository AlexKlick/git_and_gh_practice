My favorite travel has been a trip that I took to Whistler with my family and cousins in 2007. We went skiing and it was life altering.
I am originally from Michigan. We don't have mountains, only small hills really. The mountain I grew up skiing on was basically 
a 300 ft tall tilted hockey rink. I had been to some bigger places, like Killington in Vermont, but Whistler is on a whole different scale.
It really was crazy going up the peak chair, which literally goes directly up a 300 foot cliff face, but my favorite area was the Blackcomb 
backcountry off the backside of Blackcomb glacier.
